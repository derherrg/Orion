# Orion

### About Orion
This is my personal fork of the [original Casper-theme for Ghost](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper). It is named *Orion* because Casper was the name of the Command Module of the Apollo 16 mission, and Orion was the name of the corresponding Lunar Module. And just like the lander eventually uncoupled from the Command Module, this theme now uncoupled from ... blah blah, you get the idea ;-)

### Copyright & License

The original theme is released under the MIT License, and so is this fork. Have fun with it! :-)
